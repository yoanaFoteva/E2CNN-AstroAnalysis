# E2CNN-AstroAnalysis
This repository showcases my bachelor's thesis on the application of symmetric transformations in neural networks for the analysis of astronomical images. Specifically, it focuses on the development of an E(2)-Equivariant Steerable CNN tailored for galaxy classification. The main objective of this work is to leverage group symmetries (such as rotations and translations) to improve the accuracy and efficiency of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) in handling complex, large-scale astronomical datasets.

The code in this repository extensively utilizes the `e2cnn` library, a PyTorch extension specifically designed for equivariant neural networks.

For more information about the `e2cnn` library, including its features, documentation, and examples, you can visit the [e2cnn GitHub page](https://github.com/QUVA-Lab/e2cnn).
